[{"content":" Project overview Bioacoustics Learn (BL) integrates online repositories to curate technical content for marine and terrestrial bioacousticians, featuring a scalable design system developed with variable parameters for enhanced usability. Community-driven user testing and research informed continuous improvement and iterations.\nField Role Duration bioacoustics lead designer` 3 months Project Timeline The project followed the Design Thinking methodology and the Double Diamond model, incorporating both divergent and convergent thinking. It was not linear, with overlaps and iterations occurring from the early stages.\n1 Research: 3 weeks\n2 Define: 2 weeks\n3 Ideate: 1 week\n4 Prototype: 1 month\n5 Test: 1 week\nStep 1: Research In the field of bioacoustics, user research was vital for supporting the work of bioacousticians, with a primary focus on understanding the behaviors and needs of both human users and marine and terrestrial animal subjects interacting with sound-based technologies. This multidisciplinary approach involved contextual online analysis, thematic analysis, and interaction analysis through observation, long interviews with open-ended questions and specific instances of interaction within mailing subscription lists, Stack Exchange bioacoustics, Wild Labs, among others. These platforms facilitated the collection of insights into the ways bioacousticians navigate the precise analysis and interpretation of complex acoustic data through the use of multiple software and analysis techniques. The user research also included a literature review of 15 academic papers related to the topic to understand more about the workflow of bioacousticians. Additionally, a snowballing effect was utilized to reach individuals through provided contacts, resulting in 21 survey participants and 5 initial interviews. Grounded in the knowledge of animal behaviors and needs, these techniques provide valuable insights for the development of bioacoustic monitoring solutions and the design of intuitive interfaces to enhance the work of bioacousticians.\nUser research: mixed methods\nResearch type Tool Literature review Primary Survey 21 participants Primary Interviews 5 interviews Secondary Literature review 15 papers Secondary Contextual 7 channels Step 2: Define In the first convergent phase of the project, eight problem statements were defined and asked for validation from a small group of users. As the field was unknown prior to this project, it was important to validate at an early stage the main problem. After receiving some answers a user suggested that focusing on a single software was not a good approach since several softwares were needed at different moments.\nProblem statement: the user needs guidance in selecting the most suitable tools for processing and visualizing large volumes of marine data. How might we develop a decision-making tool that can assist the user. Four personas were created to illustrate the different needs of users: primary persona wants to get a grip and learn new software to conduct research for her PhD. It was also considered someone coming from another background like data scientist.\nThe competitor analysis was created through element and combined with pluses and deltas allowed to visualize the patterns in learning center and how did users felt about them. Microsoft Learn was considered as best-in-class and the task analysis was conducted with it.\nTo streamline the learning experience and reduce barriers to entry, a userflow was created. Through iterations, it was defined that fewer steps are needed to start learning, with no log in or sign up required to begin. To better understand and support the user\u0026rsquo;s educational goals, a user journey was mapped out. Considering that the user goal is to take a course to apply it later in their research, the range of available courses was expanded based on user validations.\nStep 3: Ideate The ideation stage, characterized by divergent thinking, began with a design studio involving three participants (including myself). The primary goal was to generate ideas and validate them collaboratively through iterative processes. The participants, while not bioacousticians, were scientists working in academia. This session was highly successful, as it introduced the main concepts and identified how users prefer to receive information and the types of information that are important to them. Having previously mapped out an initial information architecture proved crucial. By the end of the session, key ideas agreed upon included the selection of learning paths and the option to filter courses to match users\u0026rsquo; specific needs and the importance of an effective onboarding process.\nDesign studio Step 4: Prototype FeaturesDescription of step 4\u0026hellip; Content related to step 4.\nDevices Design strategy Platform desktop, tablet, mobile desktop first IOs Step 5: Test Description of step 5\u0026hellip; Content related to step 5.\nSurvey Tables aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports supports them out-of-the-box.\nParticipants Seniority Bob 27 Alice 23 Inline Markdown within tables Italics Bold Code italics bold code Syntax markdown Copy ![Image 1](1.jpg) ![Image 2](2.jpg) 1 ![Image 1](1.jpg) ![Image 2](2.jpg) Result Trying gif Photo by mymind and Luke Chesser on Unsplash\nWelcome to Hugo theme Stack.
