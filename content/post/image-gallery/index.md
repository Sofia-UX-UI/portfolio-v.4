<!--## Project overview

Bioacoustics Learn (BL) integrates online repositories to curate technical content for marine and terrestrial bioacousticians, featuring a scalable design system developed with variable parameters for enhanced usability. Community-driven user testing and research informed continuous improvement and iterations.

| Field   | Role     | Duration   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| *bioacoustics* | *lead designer*` | `3 months` |

## Project Timeline

The project followed the Design Thinking methodology and the Double Diamond model, incorporating both divergent and convergent thinking. It was not linear, with overlaps and iterations occurring from the early stages.

`1 Research: 3 weeks`

`2 Define: 2 weeks`

`3 Ideate: 1 week`

`4 Prototype: 1 month`

`5 Test: 1 week`  

## Step 1: Research-->

Hugo theme Stack supports the creation of interactive image galleries using Markdown. It's powered by [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) and its syntax was inspired by [Typlog](https://typlog.com/).

To use this feature, the image must be in the same directory as the Markdown file, as it uses Hugo's page bundle feature to read the dimensions of the image. **External images are not supported.**

## Syntax

```markdown
![Image 1](1.jpg) ![Image 2](2.jpg)
```

## Result
