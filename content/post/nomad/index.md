# Game concept and Experience

Nomad's Notes is a wholesome adventure game that immerses players into a world of language and culture. Embark on a charming adventure as one of the world’s natural travelers to learn new languages, meet delightful characters, and journal your experiences.

For more details, the PC version of the game can be downloaded [here](https://foxracinggurl.itch.io/nomads-notes).

## Game Runthrough

## Project Overview

Nomad's notes is a collaborative end-to-end game developed as a joint project between Indie Game developers and User Experience master students from Falmouth University. The PC game embraces our cosmopolitan nature offering a combination of language learning and entertainment. The team member members were: Jess Bradshaw (Artist, Developer), Kristen Hickey (Illustrator, UX/UI), Sofía Orellano (UX/UI, Localization), Ben Watson (Developer).

| Field   | Role     | Duration   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| *gaming* | *ux/ui designer*` | `3 months` |

<!--## Project Timeline

As a collaborative project, the division of tasks mainly followed each area of expertise. Therefore, user research, academic research, market analysis, user validation and user testing were conducted by the User Experience Designers while the gaming concept, art and development, was led by the Indie Game Developers. 

`1 Initial Research and Planning: 2 weeks`

`2 Ideation and Concept Development: 2 weeks`

`3 Research: 2 weeks`

`4 Define: 2 weeks`

`5 Game Design & Mechanics: 6 weeks`

`4 Pitch Preparation: 2 weeks`

`5 User Testing & Feedback: 1 week`  

## Step 1: Initial Research and Planning

Given the 5-hour time zone difference, it was crucial to carefully select collaborative tools that would enable seamless communication and coordination. The initial planning phase also involved team-building activities to help us understand each member's strengths, which informed decisions about project direction and performance goals for each stage. Early discussions centered around whether to develop a gamified app or a full game. Since the developers had limited experience with app development and the timeline was tight, we collectively decided to focus on creating a game to avoid potential delays from the learning curve.

| --------  | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| *Github* | *Jira* | *Discord* | *Figma, Adobe suite, Miro* | *Unity, Procreate, Inkle* | *One Drive* | *Visual Studio Code* |
 

## Step 2: Ideation and Concept Development

We conducted a rapid, asynchronous ideation session using a Miro board to collaboratively explore potential directions for the project. After the initial brainstorming round, we followed up with a second round of voting, which helped us narrow down and select the final concept: designing a language learning game.

## Steps 3 & 4: Research and Define

Research was conducted across three key areas to identify market gaps, understand industry trends, and explore effective learning paths. The first area focused on market research, aiming to uncover unmet needs and analyze current offerings. User research was also carried out to understand player preferences, behaviors, and motivations, ensuring a connection with users and their expectations. Lastly, academic research examined the most effective language-learning techniques and recent applications. The ultimate goal was to innovate and create something of real value that not only resonated with users but also provided a unique experience they couldn’t easily find elsewhere.

## Steps 5: Game Design & Mechanics

Though this step was primarily conducted by the Indie Game Developers, it was an excellent opportunity to collaborate and understand more about game mechanics. My collaboration came through the Menu design which was created following accessibility guidelines. There were some iterations to match the art style of Nomad's notes.

The localization and narrative was another great point to collaborate since we decided to create the slice of the game for leaning Spanish, driven by the survey results. As a result, I contacted some friends from Spain and we decided for Valencia as the first visit. After that I created the dialogue of the characters in the coffee shop and asked some friends for voice overs. Including a native perspective into the game added valuable and genuine aspect to the game. 

## Steps 5: Pitch preparation

Pitch preparation involved presenting the project to an expert gaming panel that gaves us feedback on the investors pitch and the presentation of the game. The result was mainly positive and we took all the feedback to improve the game afterwards.
