# Concept and Experience

Character Designer is a fine-tuned generative AI tool designed to assist users in creating detailed and high-quality personalized characters.

Our tool addresses this by streamlining the character creation process, generating both character images with image stabilization and narrative backstories through text generation based on user inputs. By fine-tuning the AI with data from trending games, Character Designer ensures the delivery of high-quality images and narratives, helping users bring their creative visions to life efficiently.

## Project Overview

Character Designer is a collaborative web app developed as a final project for AI Encode Bootcamp. The team members are Jesús Vera (Front-end dev), Aleksandar Brayanov (Back-end dev), Sofía Orellano (UX/UI).

| Field   | Role     | Duration   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| *Generative AI* | *ux/ui designer*` | `2 weeks` |

## Project Timeline & my contribution

As a joint project, the division of tasks mainly followed each area of expertise. My contribution covered areas of user research, market analysis, information architecture, prototyping, and user validation.

`1 Topic selection and Planning (1 day): communication, topics proposals`

`2 Ideation and Concept Development (2 days): ideation facilitation, concept refinement`

`3 Prototyping (2 days): academic research, user insights`

`4 Front-end dev (5 days): mapping and market analysis`

`5 Back-end dev (3 days): information Architecture, prototypying & interaction`

`4 Pitch Preparation (1 day): market focus`

## Step 1: Initial Research and Planning

Character Designer was the final project of the AI Bootcamp, conducted by Encode Club. After working for several weeks jointly with the assigned team we created a list which all the 3 members contributed with different ideas. Being in the same time zone, facilitated the creation of this project greatly. To decide on which topic to focus, we created a list with ideas that later each one of us voted on. The idea of a Character Designer was one of my contributions and came after realizing the potential application of Generative AI knowledge that we had been covering through the bootcamp. It was something that could be achieved in this short time frame, original and creative.

## Iterations

{{< youtube "NRleuAFrGPo" >}}

Stack has built-in support for math typesetting using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

**It's not enabled by default side-wide,** but you can enable it for individual posts by adding `math: true` to the front matter. Or you can enable it side-wide by adding `math = true` to the `params.article` section in `config.toml`.

## Inline math

This is an inline mathematical expression: $\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887…$

## Block math

$$
    \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
$$

```markdown
$$
    \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }

$$
    f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
